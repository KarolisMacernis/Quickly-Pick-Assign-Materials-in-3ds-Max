Maxscript tool with a user interface to quickly pick and assign materials in a scene.

The main purpose of the script is to create the ability to quickly pick and assign materials in 3ds Max through the use of macroscripts without the need to use the material editor. These macroscripts can be used by assigning hotkeys to them or any custom ui items like toolbars or menus creating quick access to commonly used materials. These actions can also be accessed through the buttons in the window generated by the script.

# Features
- __Material Slots__: The user interface consists of a dialog with a variable number of material slots. Each slot has a pick button, an assign button, and a label that displays the name of the picked material.

- __Pick Material__: The pick button allows the user to select an object in the scene. If the selected object has a material, the material is stored in the corresponding slot and the label is updated to display the name of the material. If the selected object doesn't have a material, the slot is cleared and the label is updated to "No material selected."

- __Assign Material__: The assign button allows the user to assign the material in the corresponding slot to the currently selected objects in the scene. If there's no material in the slot, a message is printed to the console.

- __Variable Number of Slots__: The dialog includes a spinner that allows the user to change the number of material slots. After changing the value of the spinner, the user must press the "Apply" button to see the changes. This will recreate the dialog with the new number of slots. When the window is recreated the picked materials are preserved in their respective slots.

- __MacroScripts for Hotkeys, Menus, and Toolbars__: The script dynamically creates MacroScripts for each pick and assign function. These MacroScripts can be assigned to hotkeys, menus, or toolbars in 3ds Max for quick and easy access. The MacroScripts are named "PickMaterialX" and "AssignPickedMaterialX", where X is the index of the material slot and can be found under the category "Custom Scripts" in the Hotkey Editor or in the Customize User Interface window.
